Time Correction for RXTE PCA Data

This is here only because I keep losing it.

Applies the relavent time correction for RXTE's PCA detector data. Also the time correction catalogue (tdc.cat) is included in the repository (because, let's face it, I keep losing that too).

The original algorithm in C is at: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/abc/xCC.c

This short tool was developed to investigate it during a PhD seminar. The seminar booklet (in Turkish): https://eayd.in/phd-sem
